Thanks for checking out my client! Credit to Awbz for helping to set up both the server and the client.
Features include:
Clothing and containers no longer decay.
Adobe walls no longer crumble.
Tule Stumps will regrow into reeds after 1 hour, however you can still dig them up to get adobe if they're in your way or something.
Players always spawn as Eve, and will always spawn in the same location.
Awbz zoomout mod (left/right arrow keys to zoom in or out, shift+del to suicide, tells age and other useful stats).

How to use this client
Step 1: Download, and unzip so you get the OneLife_v65c folder.
Step 2: Go into the folder, and use the exe inside to play; the customServer is already set to my private server.
If you are not already in my discord, you must join that to recieve the password. (Invite only)
DISCLAIMER: DO NOT input your email or account key you recieved from the official game (If you bought it). Leaking of the password and/or Discord server is prohibited, and will not be tolerated. You may be excluded from playing on the OHOLocracy server if you are to do this.
Enjoy the server.
